# C# Study Projects

This repository contains a collection of C# projects and assignments covering various language features and concepts.

## Projects and Topics Covered:

*   **[MiscAssignments](/MiscAssignments)**
    *   Contains miscellaneous assignments, including:
        *   `AssignmentAreaOfCircle.cs`: Calculating the area of a circle.
        *   `AssignmentNearestThousand.cs`: Rounding numbers to the nearest thousand.
        *   `AssignmentTimeCalculator.cs`: Performing time-based calculations.
        *   `AssignmentTypeConversion.cs`: Exploring C# type conversion.
        *   `UpgradeHDRPtoURPMaterials.cs`: (Likely a Unity-related script for material conversion).
        *   Working with JSON data (`persons.json`, `tv-shows.json`).
*   **[Section22](/Section22)**
    *   Assignments and potentially an introduction to Class Libraries (`ClassLibrary`).
*   **[Section23/AnonymousTypesAndTuples](/Section23/AnonymousTypesAndTuples)**
    *   Focuses on C# features like Anonymous Types and Tuples.
*   **[Section25](/Section25)**
    *   Covers LINQ (Language Integrated Query) with practice examples (`LINQpractice`, `LinqTask`).
*   **[section26](/section26)**
    *   Practice with `String`, `DateTime`, and `Math` classes (`StringDateTimeMathPactrice`).
    *   An assignment on data masking using string manipulation (`assignment56/DataMaskingWithStrings`).
*   **[Section27](/Section27)**
    *   Working with Files and Directories (`FileAndDirectory`).
    *   Understanding Number Systems and Encoding (`NumberSystemsEncoding`).
*   **[Section28/ExceptionHandling](/Section28/ExceptionHandling)**
    *   Demonstrates Exception Handling techniques in C#, including logging errors (`ErrorLog.txt`).

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JNDEV0/Csharp-study-projects.git
    cd Csharp-study-projects
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific project/section folder.**
3.  **Open the Project/Solution:**
    *   Most projects will likely be console applications or class libraries. You can open `.csproj` files with an IDE like Visual Studio, VS Code (with C# extension), or JetBrains Rider, or compile and run them using the .NET CLI (`dotnet run` if it's a runnable project).
    *   Look for `.sln` (solution) files within section folders (e.g., in `Section28/ExceptionHandling`) to open multiple related projects.

## Prerequisites

*   .NET SDK (the version will depend on the projects, but likely .NET 6, .NET 7, or .NET 8 based on `net8.0` found in `Section28`).
*   A C# compatible IDE or editor.
